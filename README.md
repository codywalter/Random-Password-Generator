Description: A password is randomly generated based on the criteria the user selects.

When the user clicks "Generate Password" they will be asked how many characters they would like to include. If it is not between 8-128 they will be asked again to select an appropriate number of characters to include.

Once all parameters have been met a random password will generate in the text field.
